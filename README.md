# Library Online Rental System

## Project Description

This project objective is to develop a webservice to support the operation of a book library website.
The service is composed of a web application programming interface using REST, developed in the ASP.net framework. To
support the web application data, a MySql relational database is used.
The proposed system enables users to browse a comprehensive collection of books, apply advanced search capabilities and
filter options based on categories, authors, and publishers. The user is able to rent or suggest new book additions to
the library as well as provide ratings. The rented books must be collected at the library and are not sent over delivery
service.
The library manager is responsible to maintain data, including books and rentals, the admin is responsible to maintain
user and access data.
